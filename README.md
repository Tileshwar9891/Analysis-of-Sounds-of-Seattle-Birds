# Analysis-of-Sounds-of-Seattle-Birds
This study leverages deep learning and neural networks to classify bird species by analyzing their vocalizations, using both binary and multiclass classification on data from Xeno-Canto and raw sound test clips.
The analysis revolves around voice recognition with the use of deep learning methods. In this analysis, the neural network models have been utilized for the binary and multiclass classification of bird species based on the provided data and evaluated their performance on three test voices. The binary classification, utilizing neural networks, achieved accuracies of 90.32% and 80.64% with batch sizes of 32 and 64, respectively. In this analysis, the focus was on segregating between two bird species, 'American Crow' (amecro) and ‘Blue Jay’ (blujay). This high level of accuracy underscores the efficiency of neural network architectures in differentiating between two classes of bird calls. The next model addressed multiclass classification and provided some good results with accuracies of 59.77% and 64.94% with batch sizes of 32 and 64, respectively, spread among the 12 bird species. This analysis highlights the ability of machine learning algorithms to correctly recognize different types of bird songs. Besides evaluating model performance on internal datasets, we also examined the classification of real test data consisting of raw sound clips. Some of these clips contained sounds from multiple bird species, making classification challenging for automatic systems. In the analysis of three test clips, our model demonstrated its capability to predict bird species with a top-5 classification output. For the first test, the 'American Crow' (amecro) was identified as the most probable species with a confidence score of 51.68%, followed by the 'Western Meadowlark' (wesmea) at 44.45%. In the second test, the 'Western Meadowlark' predicted as the primary bird with a confidence score of 86.06%, while the 'American Crow' followed with 13.51%. Similarly, in the third test, the 'Western Meadowlark' and 'American Crow' were the top contenders, with a score of 49.77% and 47.55% respectively. These outcomes suggest the model's consistent performance in identifying dominant bird species across various audio samples, underscoring its efficiency in multiclass bird classification tasks.
